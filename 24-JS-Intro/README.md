## Intro to Javascript
- Invented to compete with native Desktop applications
- HTML, CSS, and JS (behavior)
- The index.html file MUST contain a script tag reference to the script.js file

### Learning a New Programming language
- How to Debug (
  console.log(), alert(), debugger
  )
- Documentation [MDN]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/))

### Difference between Ruby and JS
- lots of diff ways to declare variables (var, let, const)
- sometimes more explicit (iterators, with your return values)
- sometimes you don't have to be as explicit
- type coercion

### Datatypes

Primitive Data Types
- Boolean (true or false; but everything has a truthy or falsey)
- Numbers (be careful of floating points)
- String (concatenation, interpolation)
- null
- undefined
- Symbols technically (not used though)

Objects
- object
- arrays
- functions 


### Pass by Value versus Pass by Reference


### Functions as Objects
- all the difference ways to write functions
- hoisting
