## Welcome!

## Keep in mind while learning at Flatiron School
  - Lab reviews vs Lectures
  - Read error messages
  - check our assumptions
  - refactoring!
  - `time-boxing`
  - Code Along?
  - stress management, etc.

## Explore Learn.co Landing Page
  - calendar
  - links to lecture code / videos

## Complete the lab!
  - TDD
  - `binding.pry`
  - Ruby Iterators

## Lab Deployments
  - Roughly 80 "Deployments"
  - Most are from Pre-Work!
  - Ff you did not complete the pre-work, it should be a long night

## Daily schedule (roughly):
* Discussion Question (be here on time!)
* Lecture in the morning or afternoon
* Lab time in the morning or afternoon (sometimes)
* New labs at 4-5pm to be done before the next morning (Homework)
* Pairing Labs will sometimes take the place of morning/afternoon labs
